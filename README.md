[PortableRest 2.4](http://github.com/AdvancedREI/PortableRest)=================PortableRest is a Portable Class Library for implementing REST API clients in other Portable Class Libraries. It leverages JSON.NET for rapid, customizable serialization, as well as the Microsoft.Bcl.Async library for awaitable execution on any platform. It is designed to be largely drop-in compatible with RestSharp, though you will need to make some changes and recompile if you are upgrading from that solution.Works on .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8, and Windows 8.x, as well as iOS and Android through Xamarin.Design Goals----------+ Be able to write one REST client wrapper that can be used on all current-generation Microsoft platforms (without the techniques we have to use for [XamlEssentials](http://github.com/AdvancedREI/XamlEssentials)).+ Have more control over serialization of property names (so you're not limited to the "remove all dashes" convention of RestSharp).+ Be able to have objects be easily serializable to local storage using standard techniques, without jumping through a lot of hoops.What's New?-----------### Version 2.4+ Ability to control parameter encoding. Example: `RestRequest.AddParameter("test", someStream, ParameterEncoding.Base64);`.+ Ability to add request-specific headers. This is useful in situations where the value might change between requests, for example with expiring OAuth tokens. Example: `RestRequest.AddHeader("X-Authorization", yourTokenHere);`+ The RestClient will now set the UserAgent for you if you do not set the property yourself. The format will be `"YourAssemblyTitleAttributeValue Major.Minor.Revision (PortableRest Major.Minor.Revision)"`+ In addition, you can call `RestClient.SetUserAgent<SomeTypeFromYourRestLibrary>(someString)`, which in the above example would replace `YourAssemblyTitleAttributeValue` with the contents of `someString`.More Info-----------[Read more about PortableRest on our blog](http://advancedrei.com/blogs/development/introducing-portablerest-v2-cross-platform-rest-client-for-dotnet-apps)Quick start-----------Install the NuGet package: `Install-Package PortableRest`, clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/advancedrei/portablerest.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/advancedrei/portablerest/zipball/master).If you are planning on redistributing your own PortableRest-based client, such as our http://gaug.es Client, you need to make sure your Portable profile does not use .NET 4.0, Silverlight 4.0, or Windows Phone 7.X. Having those platforms available will cause this package to fail to install. If you need support for those platforms, create an issue and we'll investigate the possibility of adding support.Please see the unit tests project, [Bing.RestClient](https://github.com/advancedrei/bing.restclient), or [Xbox.Music](https://github.com/advancedrei/xbox.music) for examples of how to leverage PortableRest in your REST client.Bug tracker-----------Have a bug?
